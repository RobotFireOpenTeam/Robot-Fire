## Robots (Classes / Their Tasks)
Standard Class (Robot (Non-Playing Class / Parent Class) ):
Robots can move.
Robots have different movement speeds.
Robots have inventory slots (weapons, mods, cargo).
Robots can carry loads with them: small boxes and boxes on themselves, trolleys on a trailer.
Robots can be repaired (using spare parts).
The player can switch between free robots connected to the docking station.
Robots can be rebuilt on the docking station, without the cost of spare parts.
Each robot has a role that defines its characteristics.

From the roles of robots: **Trooper**, **Builder**, **Engineer**.
- **Trooper**: can carry assault rifles and more armor. Capturing points and thus providing the team with various resources. Purpose: attack and capture new territories.
- **Builder**: can use a special weapon in one slot, can drag large loads (up to 5 trolleys) over long distances. Purpose: logistics and strengthening of territories.
- **Engineer**: can only carry special weapons. Creates weapons, ammo, spare parts, improvements for robots. Goal: Improve the army of robots.
